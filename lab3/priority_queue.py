"""
AI-Generated Module for Huffman Priority Queue.

This module provides a PriorityQueue class tailored
for building a Huffman Encoding Tree.

The sorting logic for the queue is:
1.  Lowest weight has the highest priority.
2.  If weights are tied, a single-letter node has priority over
    a multi-letter node.
3.  If both weights and types are tied, nodes are sorted alphabetically
    by their symbol.
